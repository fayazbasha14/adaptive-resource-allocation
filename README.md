This project implements an Adaptive Resource Allocation System designed for modern multiprogramming environments.
The objective is to dynamically distribute CPU time and memory resources among multiple programs based on real-time system performance.

Traditional static allocation methods often lead to bottlenecks, starvation, or inefficient resource usage.
This system overcomes those issues by continuously monitoring system load and adjusting allocations automatically to maintain optimal performance.
