# Adaptive Resource Allocation in Multiprogramming Systems

This project implements an **Adaptive Resource Allocation algorithm** for multiprogramming systems.  
The goal is to allocate system resources (like CPU time, memory, and I/O bandwidth) efficiently based on  
dynamic system load, process priority, and real-time resource utilization metrics.

The system uses:
- Variable Priority Allocation  
- Dynamic Threshold Adjustment  
- Process Load Monitoring  
- Feedback-based Resource Rebalancing  

This ensures optimal resource usage, avoids starvation, and improves throughput in multiprogramming environments.
